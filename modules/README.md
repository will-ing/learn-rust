# Modules

What are modules in Rust?

Modules help with readability and scope as well as privacy.

Contain:

1. Functions
2. Structs
3. Enums
4. Traits
5. Other Modules

*Modules are not mapped to files but to the `mod` keyword*

You can install cargo modules by:

```terminal
cargo install cargo-modules

cargo modules generate tree --with-types
```
